# UFOs 

## Overview of Project
For this analysis we were asked to create a webpage to help present data on UFO sightings. The data pulled from data.js & app.js is used to create a table on selected criteria. The user can enter infomration into the filter search for results. 

### Results 
With the table that was created user can successfully pull UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, & shape. With this the user has multiple ways to pull desire information to narrow down resullts for certain searches.  

##  Summary 
Overall a clean webpage was created that for the most part would be considered user friendly. The only thing may cause some frustration is the filter is case sensitive. For example if user were to submit UFO sightings for the state of Florida as "FL" instead of "fl" the search will not work.
